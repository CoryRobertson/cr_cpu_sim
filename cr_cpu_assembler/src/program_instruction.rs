// TODO: add a new program instruction, called variable
//  variable syntax could be let x = 5
//  all variables are u32 in size at the moment
//  a variable is stored in the binary at the address it takes up, and is loaded when the binary is read since the dram is copied from the binary
//  all variables could take spaces in stack ? or the second quarter of dram?
//  if variables take up stack space, then the stack pointer needs to start after all variable declarations, which could be done with a simple instruction aded to the beginning of every binary
//  this would be something like `imovel sp <number of variables found in binary at compile time>`
